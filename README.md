This is my course work project that I made for A-Level computer science.
This is a game where you control a gorilla with the mouse and fling yourself around the map
while punching any emenies that you see, you can also collect fruits for a power up and more score
as you race to the top of the map.
It has multiple screens and a level creation mode but the current test level is not very good for a user experience.
All artwork was done by me but sound effects and musics were not done by me.

This is what the game looks like:

You can run this project by running main.py and the only dependancy is pygame.
You can move around by right clicking on most branches and leafs and then moving the mouse around.
You can attack by clicking left click and moving your mouse into the enemies.
